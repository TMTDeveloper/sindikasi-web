Simple shortcode that shows hidden text when you hover over an image.

== Description ==

NG Image Hover adds a new shortcode called `[hover-effect]` that allows you to insert an image and a piece of hidden text. The text then reveals itself when you hover over the image.

Here's the shortcode to get things started:

`[hover-effect image="image url here" alt="alt text here"]Your hidden text here[/hover-effect]`

Simply plop that into your post, replace each field with your own values, and see it in action!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ng-image-hover` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add this shortcode to a post to see it in action: `[hover-effect image="image url here" alt="alt text here"]Your hidden text here[/hover-effect]`

== Screenshots ==

1. The view of the settings panel.
2. A screenshot of the social share icons automatically added to the Twenty Fifteen theme. This also shows the default button styles applied.
